# House Price Prediction in Bangalore  

## Project Overview  
This project predicts house prices in Bangalore using past data. The model estimates prices based on factors like house size, location, and number of bedrooms. It uses a machine learning model to help buyers and sellers understand the real estate market.  

## Model: Linear Regression  
Linear Regression is a method used to find the relationship between house price (dependent variable) and other factors like size, location, etc. It creates a straight line to predict prices based on the data provided.  

### Steps in Linear Regression:  
1. **Prepare the Data**: Fix missing data and convert text into numbers.  
2. **Train the Model**: Teach the model to learn the relationship between factors and price.  
3. **Test the Model**: Check how well the model predicts prices.  

## Workflow  
1. **Understand the Problem**:  
   - The goal is to predict house prices in Bangalore.  
   - Identify the factors (features) that affect prices.  

2. **Collect Data**:  
   - Use data about houses in Bangalore, including size, area, price, etc.  

3. **Clean the Data**:  
   - Handle missing information.  
   - Convert locations and other text data into numbers.  
   - Standardize numerical values.  

4. **Analyze the Data**:  
   - Look at patterns and trends in the data.  
   - Check for errors or unusual values.  

5. **Choose Features**:  
   - Select the most important factors that affect house prices.  

6. **Build the Model**:  
   - Use Linear Regression to predict prices.  
   - Split data into training and testing sets to ensure accuracy.  

7. **Evaluate the Model**:  
   - Measure accuracy using simple metrics like error rates.  

8. **Deploy the Model**:  
   - Create a tool where users can enter details and get price predictions.
